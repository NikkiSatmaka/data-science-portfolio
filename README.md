# Nikki Satmaka's Data Science Portofolio

## Introduction
This is my Data Science and Machine Learning portofolio collected in one repository. This repository is a living, breathing project, and would be updated in accordance as my portofolio grows from time to time.

## Showcased Projects

Here are some projects that are showcased here:

#### Credit Card Customer Segmentation

Build an unsupervised machine learning model to perform customer segmentation. Three algorithms were used in this research, to be compared and studied.

#### Fake News Identifier

Build a NLP text classification model to identify whether a news is more likely to be fake or not. The model is built using TensorFlow Keras library.
